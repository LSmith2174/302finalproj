Challenge 04
Laura Smith
3/6/23

+20 code written out for a button that generates two random numbers
+20 code is on github

(not sure if the rubric is for challenge 4 specifically or the project in general so this is for the challenge specifically)

This week I learned the godot engine and what I can do in it by following and watching these tutorials: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjB0H3BgzTI&list=PLJ690cxlZTgIsmdEhFufnB7O6KWoMS8M6. I then made the repository with github desktop so that I can push the game's files easier. I also set up where the board will be and made a roll button that generates two numbers between 1 and 6 which are the dice's roll. Next I will create the board and the player's pieces
